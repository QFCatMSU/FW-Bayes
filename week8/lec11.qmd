## Purpose

- Background
- Recognizing dependency in simple models
- How can we deal with dependency problems 
    - Introduction to spatial random effects

## Why do we care about space 

- Most of our problems in ecology and mgmt are inherently spatial

## Nearby things tend to be more alike

## However...

- It is really hard to estimate spatial (or spatial-temporal) dynamics in most statistical models

[Sir Ronald Fisher]{.footerRight}

## Spatial dependency poses issues for traditional experimental design 

- Statistical theory of experimental designs (Fisher 1935)

[Paraphrased from Fisher 1935]{.footerRight}

## Spatial dependency poses issues for traditional experimental design 

- Statistical theory of experimental designs (Fisher 1935)
    - *After choosing the area we usually have no guidance   beyond the widely verified fact that patches in close proximity are commonly more alike…than those which are further apart*

- Fisher avoided space with the introduction of randomization into the scientific method

## Observational data represent the wilder side of science and statistical inference

## Observational data represent the wilder side of science and statistical inference 

- Great potential for biased inference

[sensu Walters 1986; Cressie and Wikle 2010]{.footerRight}

## Observational data represent the wilder side of science and statistical inference 

- Great potential for biased inference
    - Wrong operating model 
    - Unmeasured yet influential covariates
    - Lack of replication or randomization 

[sensu Walters 1986; Cressie and Wikle 2010]{.footerRight}

## Observational data represent the wilder side of science and statistical inference 

- Great potential for biased inference
    - Wrong operating model 
    - Unmeasured yet influential covariates
    - Lack of replication or randomization 
- Causal inference more challenging than in controlled experiments

    - Unmeasured yet influential covariates
    - Lack of replication or randomization 
- Causal inference more challenging than in controlled experiments 
- Notions of space and time even more relevant?

## Hierarchical modeling as a powerful tool for ecological inference

- Unifying field of statistics
- Many technical benefits
- Helps deal with dependency 
    - i.e., Hurlburt's pseudoreplication
- So we are going to use these to address the spatial dependency issue

# Recognizing dependency in statistical models 

## What do we look for when checking statistical models? 

- Zuur and Ieno 2016 offered a 10 step approach

## Protocol for presenting regression-type analyses

1. State appropriate questions
2. Visualize the experimental design
3. Conduct data exploration
4. Identify the dependency structure in the data
5. Present a statistical model
6. Fit said model
7. "validate" the model
8. Interpret and present output
9. Model visualizations
10. Simulate from the model 

[Zuur and Ieno 2016]{.footerRight}

## The take home point from Zuur and Ieno

<br>

"*Before starting the analysis carefully consider which
observations for your response variable can be dependent.
If dependency is present, apply a statistical technique that
is able to cope with it*"

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

## Thinking about dependency 

- Suppose samples are collected by different laboratories
    - Perhaps due to differences in techniques or scientists themselves among laboratories, we likely have among-lab dependency 

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

## Thinking about dependency 

-   Suppose related species are analyzed together in one analysis 
    - Perhaps due to similarities between the species we have among-species dependency 

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

## Thinking about dependency 

-   Suppose we take repeated measurements on individual rats
    - Perhaps due to individual differences among rats, the data scientists collect from one rat is more likely to be similar to other data from collected from that rat 

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

## What dependency is not 

- Two sites have high bird counts, and they weren't sampled by the same person or lab 
- However, both sites have a low cover measurement, which is the cause of the high bird counts

## Visualize experimental design: spatial dependency

```{R echo = T, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggqfc)
data <- read.table(file = "data/ph_dat.txt", header = TRUE, dec = ".")
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Easting, y = Northing)) +
  geom_point(shape = 16) + theme_qfc()
```

```

## Running an analysis

```{R echo = T, eval = T}
data$fForested <- factor(data$Forested,
                        levels = c(1, 2),
                        labels = c("Yes", "No"))
data$LOGAltitude <- log10(data$Altitude)

# Model selected using some stepwise AIC approach
fit <- lm(pH ~ LOGAltitude + SDI + fForested + LOGAltitude:fForested, 
          data = data)
E3 <- resid(fit)

```

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}


## Validating the model 

```{R echo = T, eval = T}
plot(x = fitted(fit), y = E3)
abline(h = 0, v = 0)

```

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

## Validating the model 

```{R echo = T, eval = T}
hist(E3)
```

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

## Validating the model 

```{R echo = T, eval = T}
# Independence due to model misfit
plot(x = data$SDI, y = E3) # residuals vs. predictors 
abline(h = 0, v = 0)

```

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

```{R echo = T, eval = T}
# Independence due to model misfit
plot(x = data$LOGAltitude, y = E3) # residuals vs. predictors 
abline(h = 0, v = 0)

```

[Zuur et al. 2017]{.footerRight}

## Can we find spatial patterns? 

```{R echo = T, eval = F}
# Can we find spatial patterns in the residuals?
data$E3 <- resid(fit)
data$my_cex <- 3 * abs(data$E3) / max(data$E3) + 0.75
data$sign <- as.numeric(data$E3 >=0) + 1
data$my_pch <- c(1, 16)[data$sign]

# Convert Easting / Northing to km
data$easting_km <- data$Easting/1000
data$northing_km <- data$Northing/1000

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = easting_km, y = northing_km)) +
  geom_point(size = data$my_cex, shape = data$my_pch) +
  ylab("northing (km)") + xlab("easting (km)")

```
