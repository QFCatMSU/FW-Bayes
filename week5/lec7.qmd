- Demonstrate how those models can be powerful for answering bespoke resource management questions
- Demonstrate some tricks for fitting nonlinear models 
- Gain familiarity with non-standard models and estimating them in Stan

## Nonlinear modeling is like wandering down a sketchy alley with no end in sight
