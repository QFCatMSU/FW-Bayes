## What is a state space model 

- State space models are a popular modeling framework for analyzing time-series data 

- Useful for modeling population dynamics, metapopulation dynamics, fisheries stock assessments, integrated population models, capture recapture data, animal movement, and biodiversity data

## What is a state space model 

- State space models are a popular modeling framework for analyzing time-series data 

- Useful for modeling population dynamics, metapopulation dynamics, fisheries stock assessments, integrated population models, capture recapture data, animal movement, and biodiversity data

- Quite popular because they directly model temporal autocorrelation in a way that helps differentiate process variation vs. observation error.

    - For toy model, this means that the state at time $t, z_{t}$ depends only on the state at the previous time step $z_{t-1}$

- Diagnostics in the Bayesian framework
    - Correlation between parameters

        - If your model is non-identifiable, parameters are usually biased with large variances
- *One should choose priors with great care for SSMs*  

[Auger-Methe et al. 2021]{.footerRight}

## Remedies for nonidentifiability 

- Reformulate the model 
- Make simplifying assumptions when data are limited 
- Estimate measurement errors externally 
- Integrate additional data
- Try to use replicated observations 
- Match temporal resolution between states and observations 
    - If one has a data set with locations every 8 h, it would be challenging to estimate
behavioral states lasting <16–24 h

## Wrap up

- SSMs are flexible models for time series that can be used to answer a broad range of ecological questions
-  They can be used to model univariate or multivariate time series
-  SSMs can be linear or nonlinear, and have discrete or continuous time steps
- Key point:
