## Purpose

hello 

-   Introduce Generalized Linear Models
    - In particular, the Poisson and binomial GLMs
-   Statistical models as response = signal + noise 
-   
-   Write code to elicit simple models and implement Bayesian inference in Stan
-   Use the cmdstanr interface
-   Develop familiarity with a few packages that make your life easier
-   Walk through some model diagnostics
