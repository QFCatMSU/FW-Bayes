## Before we get started

```{R echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("QFCatMSU/gg-qfc")
library(ggqfc)
```

## Testing that installation

```{R echo = T, eval = F}
pp_roll() # test posterior predictive function  

```

## Purpose

- Today we introduce a powerful extension of mixed effects models
  - Random slopes (aka varying effects models)
  - Repent for our earlier sins
- Adventures in covariance a la McElreath (2023)
- Simulate a varying effects problem
- Discuss both a centered and noncentered version of this model
  - Jump back and forth between presentation and live coding demo

## A note up front

- This lecture is drawing heavily on McElreath (2023), and much of the code and analyses are adapted from information in that text
