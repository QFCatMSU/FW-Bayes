-   Course organization
-   Some Bayesian examples from my own work
-   Philosophy and course themes
-   Software and website
-   Expectations and disclaimers
-   Break

## Introduction to FW 891

-   Welcome
-   Housekeeping
    -   Washrooms, Zoom, UPLA, office hours, etc.
-   Round-table introductions
    -   Background, area of study, why are you here, ice breaker

## Syllabus

-   Going to do everything through Github
    -   <https://github.com/QFCatMSU/FW-Bayes>
-   Syllabus, links to readings, etc.
-   All presentations and code
-   Office hours by appointment
    -   [cahill11\@msu.edu](mailto:cahill11@msu.edu){.email}

## Course organization

-   Monday lectures where we generally cover theory/concepts
-   Wednesday labs where we work on implementation and in-class exercises
-   4 homework assignments
-   1 class project
    -   Preliminary draft due 25 Sept
    -   Final presentation/write-up 6 and 11 Dec

## Recommended background

-   Previous experience with statistics
-   Previous experience programming
    -   for-loops, functions, data visualization
-   You can get by without this background, but you should expect to put in more time

## Bayesian examples from my work

![](images/LBR.png){fig-align="center" width="800" height="400"}

-   Decline was *not* statistically significant (Frequentist)
-   88% chance of population decline (Bayesian)

## My philosophy on statistical modeling

-   The reliability of inferences matters when *management of public-trust natural resources* might be affected by your analyses
    -   We will spend *a lot* of time evaluating models
-   Intuition is critical in applied ecological analyses
    -   We will be trying to improve your intuition with Bayesian modeling
-   There are rarely cookbook solutions to hard problems
    -   All about improving your statistical toolbox

## Course themes

-   Development of fairly advanced implementation skills using R and Stan
    -   Why?
-   There are easier ways to do some of the analyses we will learn
-   By learning to do easy things the hard way, the hard things become easy (Royle and Dorazio 2008)
-   Open source and reproducible science

## Software, implementation, website

-   We are primarily going to use R and Stan
-   Recommend Rstudio
-   Lectures and code will be available through GitHub
    -   You do not need to know how to use GitHub, but that is where you can find code and presentations

## Stan is not:

## What is Stan, why use it?

-   Stan is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation

-   Named after [Stanislav Ulam](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)

-   Unique class of algorithms (HMC, NUTS), scales well

-   Cannot do everything (discrete unknowns)

## Expectations

-   Be kind
-   Make an honest effort to learn this stuff
-   Share your code
    -   I share my code with all of you, so please do the same
    -   Sharing code is critical for reproducible science
-   This course lies at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, ecology, and numerical computing
    -   Failure is okay and to be expected

## Some disclaimers

1.  Bayesian statistics is a vast and difficult topic
2.  This is not a mathematical statistics course
3.  I will do my best to track down answers
4.  I don't know everything\
5.  Please ask questions
6.  When in doubt, see disclaimers 3-5

## Break

-   Return in 10 minutes

## Outline: Part II

## Statistical inference essentials

-   This class is about model-based inference
    -   Focus on the development of arbitrarily abstract statistical models
-   These models always contain:
    -   Deterministic (i.e., systematic) components
    -   Random (i.e., stochastic) components
-   Typically use a model to estimate parameters of interest, conduct an inference, or predict something

## Random variables: words

-   Any observation can be viewed as the realization (or outcome) of a stochastic process
    -   Phrased differently: chance plays a part in what we observe
-   Simplest example: binary outcome
    -   Alive or dead, mature or not mature, detected or sneaky (not-detected)
-   Element of chance in all of outcomes, and we need a way to deal with that

## Random variables: maths

#### Consider a model of the binary random variable Y:

$$
\text{suppose } p=\operatorname{Pr}(Y=1) \\
\operatorname{Pr}(Y=1)+\operatorname{Pr}(Y=0)=1 \\
\operatorname{Pr}(Y=0)=1-p
$$

## Bayesian statistics

-   This

## Before next class

-   Make sure you have R, Rstudio, and Stan installed and working
