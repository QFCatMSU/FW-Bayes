## R and RStudio

For this class you need to have at minimum R version 4.3 and a 2023 version of RStudio:

Downloads:

[R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

[R for Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

-   There are two download options (M1/M2 and Intel) -- your Mac will tell you if you try to install the wrong version

[RStudio for Windows and Mac](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

## Rtools (Windows only)

Make sure RStudio is closed for this step...

You need to have a C++ compiler to compile packages. The easiest way on Windows is to download and install Rtools43. [The Rtools43 installer link is on this page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html).

You need to have a version of Rtools43 from 2023. If you installed RTools43 last year then reinstall it -- it has changed.

## Homebrew (Mac only)

Make sure RStudio is closed for this step...

You have probably seen a Mac prompt to install the Command Line Developer Tools. The best way to do this is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Homebrew is an indispensable program for programmers using Mac.

To install Homebrew, copy the code on the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) page starting with `/bin/bash`. Paste the code to either a Mac Terminal or the Terminal tab in RStudio (they are the same thing) and hit Enter.

## Packages

You will need to install the following packages in R:

tidyverse, bayesplot, remotes, devtools, gridExtra, and hexbin

## Install CmdStanR

For this class we will be using the cmdstanr package. This is not a package on CRAN, so it needs to be downloaded and compiled for the GitHub page using the following R code:

`remotes::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")`

After installing camdstanr on Windows you will need to execute the dfollowing:

`cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain(fix= TRUE)`

For both Windows and Mac, you now need to install cmdstanr on your computer:

`cmdstanr::install_cmdstan(overwrite=TRUE)`

## Install QFC Package

The GGPlots created in this class are done using a theme coded by the QFC which can be installed as a package:

`devtools::install_github("QFCatMSU/gg-qfc")`

## Questions or Issues

Contact Charlie at belinsky\@msu.edu if you have any problems with the software.
