## Purpose

-   Introduce an important extention of hiearchical models where we model covariate effects as random
-   Poisson Genearlized Linear Mixed Model
- 

Another look at how we specify a joint posterior for hierarchical models (maths)
    -   Demonstrate the importance of conditional independence
-   Demonstrate a hierarchical binomial survival model for quail stocking survival
